# TV-SAM
Text-Visual-Prompt SAM (TV-SAM) is a novel multimodal medical image zero-shot segmentation algorithm, which incorporates and integrates LLM, VLM, and SAM, to autonomously generate descriptive text prompts and visual bounding box prompts from medical images, thereby enhancing SAM for zero-shot segmentation.

Our algorithm demo will be shared later, thank you for your attention.
